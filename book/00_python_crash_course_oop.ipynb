    "Objects have their own attributes. Let’s say we have an object called `cat`. A cat's attributes could include color, size, and age. Suppose we want to know the color of the `cat`. We can inspect the color attribute like this:\n",

That means that our object, `cat`, came from a class. Let's call the class `Cat`. The `Cat` class is where the attributes and methods are defined. It might look something like this:"
