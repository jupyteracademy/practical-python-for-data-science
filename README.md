# Practical Python for Data Science

Oh, hey there! Welcome to my open-source book - `Practical Python for Data Science`. This repo contains all of the code that was used to build this book. 

### Introduction 

Python is the “swiss army knife” of programming. There are several factors that contribute to its versatility:

- it has clean and human-readable syntax so it’s easy to learn
- it’s an interpreted object-oriented scripting language
- it has a strong open-source community and a large repository of Python packages

Because of its versatility, Python can be applied to both software development (e.g., building web applications and API’s) and data science (e.g., scientific computing, creating end-to-end data science pipelines). However, writing Python for data science is very different than writing Python for software devleopment. A huge part of the learning curve is getting familiar with the syntax of Python’s data science packages including but not limited to Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

In this book, we will focus on how to use Python in the context of data science. We will work with a real-life dataset and explore it using the following data science Python packages:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
