# Practical Python for Data Science

Oh, hey there! Welcome to my open-source book - `Practical Python for Data Science`. This repo contains all of the code that was used to build this book. 

Check out the online book at [www.practicalpythonfordatascience.com](www.practicalpythonfordatascience.com).

### Introduction 

Python is the "swiss army knife" of programming. There are several factors that contribute to its versatility:

- it has clean and human-readable syntax so itâ€™s easy to learn
- itâ€™s an interpreted object-oriented scripting language
- it has a strong open-source community and a large repository of Python packages

Because of its versatility, Python can be applied to both software development (e.g., building web applications and APIâ€™s) and data science (e.g., scientific computing, creating end-to-end data science pipelines). However, writing Python for data science is very different than writing Python for software devleopment. A huge part of the learning curve is getting familiar with the syntax of Pythonâ€™s data science packages including but not limited to Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

In this book, we will focus on how to use Python in the context of data science. We will work with a real-life dataset and explore it using the following data science Python packages:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
